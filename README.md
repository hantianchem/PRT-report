This executive summary was developed for the 2025 Munich Re Cup Case Competition by Team Hantian Chen, Anh Dang Phuong, and Sanjit Samanta from the University of Toronto. In response to this year’s prompt—designing a growth strategy that balances capital optimization and product diversification. We focused on helping a life insurance company, TPL, enter the U.S. Pension Risk Transfer (PRT) market.

Our approach begins with a market overview and risk assessment, followed by a detailed analysis of key pricing assumptions such as mortality modeling, discount rates, and capital constraints. We then propose a five-stage go-to-market strategy that leverages TPL’s actuarial expertise, surplus capital, and operational capabilities. The strategy is designed to be both scalable and risk-conscious, targeting mid-sized pension plans in the short term and expanding to larger transactions and international markets over time.

This submission integrates actuarial analysis, regulatory considerations, and long-term financial planning to provide a practical and data-driven roadmap for PRT market entry. All assumptions are supported by industry standards and current market insights, ensuring that our recommendations are grounded, actionable, and aligned with Munich Re’s evaluation criteria.
